# About This Project

This project explores NYC gentrification trends through data analysis, visualizations, and policy discussions. By examining changes in demographics, housing affordability, and eviction rates, this project aims to raise awareness about the impacts of gentrification on local communities. Using publicly available datasets and interactive maps, this website presents key insights into displacement patterns and advocates for equitable policies to protect vulnerable residents. The project serves as a resource for understanding gentrification's effects and promoting dialogue about solutions for inclusive urban development.

## Data Processing Steps

To analyze NYC gentrification, the following data processing steps were undertaken:

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Collected datasets from reputable sources such as NYC Open Data, academic repositories, and research publications.

2. **Data Cleaning & Standardization**
   - Removed missing or inconsistent entries.
   - Standardized column names and data formats for uniformity.
   - Geocoded addresses to map data accurately.

3. **Data Integration**
   - Merged datasets based on geographic identifiers (e.g., census tracts, ZIP codes).
   - Linked socioeconomic data with spatial datasets to visualize gentrification patterns.

4. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - Conducted statistical analyses to identify trends and correlations.
   - Created maps and charts to illustrate changes in demographics, housing prices, and displacement over time.
